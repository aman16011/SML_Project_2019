# SML_Project_2019

We worked upon Motor Imagery Classification tasks in which our aim was to classify brain signals in one of four classes namely Left Hand Moving, Right Hand Moving, Left Leg Moving and Right Leg Moving. We used band pass filter features and dimensionality reduction techniques to extract the features. We used multiple classifiers and RNN to get the result.
